# CHBE 4200 - Final Project
* As part of our final project in the course, we each created an electric longboard using a combination of 3D printing techniques.
* The primary goals of the project was to use powder bed fusion (selective laser sintering) and generative design tools available within Fusion 360 to design strong yet lightweight parts for a longboard.
* In addition, we were able to use our professor, Dr. David Florian's large format 3D printer to print a deck for the longboard. More information on the creation of this printer can be found [here](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Projects/LF3DP.html).
* To start with the end in mind, here is the final assembly design of my skateboard in Fusion 360. You are able to toggle the aluminum and polymer truck designs on and off to see the differences within the file:

# Part 1: Using Generative AI to Design Trucks
* The first step in our way to making an electric longboard was to use the cutting edge generative design technology available within Fusion 360 to create bespoke aluminum and polymer (Nylon 12) trucks that connect to the baseplate of the longboard.
* The truck is a key component of a longboard, as it distributes the weight and allows for the range of motion that drives and directs the device.

* In the designs embedded above, you can most clearly see the difference in material choice within the generative design algorithm. The sheer amount of material generated to account for the forces within my design is significantly higher in the polymer variant than the aluminum.

* But before going any further in the analysis of outcomes, I'd like to further discuss the technologies that we learned about through this process.

# Powder Bed Fusion (Selective Laser Sintering - SLS)
* PBF is an additive manufacturing process where a laser or electron beam selectively fuses powdered material to build a component layer by layer.
* This technique is particularly useful for creating complex geometries that are difficult or impossible to manufacture using traditional methods, as its specific advantage is how it allows for unsupported geometries and overhangs, which removes a major set of design constraints.

# Generative Design
* Generative design is an iterative process that harnesses the power of trained machine learning models to generate structures and shapes that meet given load constraints.
* With the user input of these goals and constraints, the software within Fusion 360 can explore many possible configurations to find the most efficient design, often appearing as a more organic, unconventional solution.

# Synergies
* The respective strengths of generative design tools and powder bed fusion allows for almost limitless possibilities in design and creation. In essence, the technology of PBF in allowing for unsupported geometries enables more possibilties and connections to explore. The resulting parts can be both strong and lightweight, if the user inputs of constraints and goals are well bounded and directed.

# Potential in Aerospace & Automotive Industry
* In automotive, and especially aerospace engineering, weight-to-performance ratio is crucial. As such, the synergistic advantages of these two technologies have great potential for solving for the dual optimization of weight and strength.
* Generative design solutions created with powder bed fusion can lead to products that use fewer resources yet outperform heavier, traditionally designed alternatives​​.
* Not only is there great potential for weight reduction, but there is also potential for the use of generative design in terms of modeling aerodynamics and optimizing for that.
* Altogether, by using algorithms with solid data points on constraints and goals, the aerospace and automotive industry can raise their efficiency of design, hopefully reducing fuel/energy consumption and going further and faster.

# Weaknesses and Limitations
*  Post-processing of metal parts -
*  

# Example Applications
*  3D Printed Racecar -
*  
*  Seatbelt example -
*  


# Going Forward
* The unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative design is paving the way for revolutionary changes in aerospace and automotive industries.
* The ability to create optimized, lightweight, and strong components is not only enhancing the performance and efficiency of these sectors but also contributing to more sustainable practices.
* As these technologies continue to evolve, they are likely to unlock even more groundbreaking possibilities, reshaping the way we approach design and manufacturing in these critical industries.
