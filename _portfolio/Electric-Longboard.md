# CHBE 4200 - Final Project
* As part of our final project in the course, we each created an electric longboard using a combination of 3D printing techniques.
* The primary goals of the project were to use powder bed fusion (selective laser sintering) and generative design tools available within Fusion 360 to design strong yet lightweight parts for a longboard.
* In addition, we were able to use our professor, Dr. David Florian's large format 3D printer to print a deck for the longboard. More information on the creation of this printer can be found [here](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Projects/LF3DP.html).
* To start with the end in mind, here is the final assembly design of my skateboard in Fusion 360. You are able to toggle the aluminum and polymer truck designs on and off to see the differences within the file:

# Part 1: Using Generative AI to Design Trucks
* The first step in our way to making an electric longboard was to use the cutting edge generative design technology available within Fusion 360 to create bespoke aluminum and polymer (Nylon 12) trucks that connect to the baseplate of the longboard.
* The truck is a key component of a longboard, as it distributes the weight and allows for the range of motion that drives and directs the device.

# Nylon 12 Polymer Truck

* In the designs embedded above, you can most clearly see the difference in material choice within the generative design algorithm. The sheer amount of material generated to account for the forces within my design is significantly higher in the polymer variant than the aluminum.

* But before going any further in the analysis of outcomes, I'd like to further discuss the technologies that we learned about through this process.

# Powder Bed Fusion (Selective Laser Sintering - SLS)
PBF is an additive manufacturing process where a laser or electron beam selectively fuses powdered material to build a component layer by layer. This technique is particularly useful for creating complex geometries that are difficult or impossible to manufacture using traditional methods. The specific advantage is that it allows for unsupported geometries and overhangs, which removes a major design constraints.

# Generative Design
GD, on the other hand, is an iterative design process that harnesses the power of trained machine learning models to generate structures and shapes that meet given load constraints. With the user input of these goals and constraints, the software can explore thousands of possible configurations to find the most efficient design, often appearing as a more organic, unconventional solution.

# Synergies
* The respective strengths of generative design tools and powder bed fusion allows for almost limitless possibilities in design and creation. In essence, the technology of PBF in allowing for unsupported geometries enables more GD possibilties and connections to explore. The resulting parts can be both strong and lightweight, if the user inputs of constraints and goals are well bounded and directed.

# Applications in Aerospace Industry
Lightweight and Strong Components
In aerospace engineering, where weight-to-performance ratio is crucial, GD offers innovative topology optimization solutions. These solutions lead to products that use fewer resources yet outperform heavier, traditionally designed alternatives​​. For instance, current research in aircraft design focuses on reducing the weight of airplanes and their components, optimizing performance, and contributing to the reduction of fuel consumption and operational costs​​.

Generating Greener Aircraft
GD is instrumental in creating new aircraft designs that are more environmentally friendly. The ability to optimize component design for weight and material efficiency directly contributes to the creation of greener aircraft​​.

Synergy with Additive Manufacturing
The synergy between GD and additive manufacturing, like PBF, is particularly potent in the aerospace industry. This combination allows for the creation of components with complex geometries that are not just lighter and stronger, but also more efficient in terms of material usage and production time​​.

Applications in Automotive Industry
Electric Vehicles
Drawing from the example provided in your documents, the project involving Vanderbilt’s Wond’ry and Nissan to build an electric longboard showcases the application of these technologies in the automotive sector. The generative design was used to create a lightweight truck hanger with an integrated motor mount, emphasizing the technology’s capability for lightweighting and consolidating assemblies​​.

Design and Manufacturing Flexibility
The project also demonstrates the flexibility in design and manufacturing. For example, the design considerations for the longboard, such as the max part size for printing and the wheel's bearing size, illustrate the precision and adaptability offered by GD in conjunction with PBF​​.

Broad Range of Materials
The use of materials like Nylon 12 and ALSi10Mg in the project points to the broad range of materials that can be utilized in PBF, offering versatility in automotive applications​​.

Conclusion
The unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative design is paving the way for revolutionary changes in aerospace and automotive industries. The ability to create optimized, lightweight, and strong components is not only enhancing the performance and efficiency of these sectors but also contributing to more sustainable practices. As these technologies continue to evolve, they are likely to unlock even more groundbreaking possibilities, reshaping the way we approach design and manufacturing in these critical industries.
