# CHBE 4200 - Final Project
* As part of our final project in the course, we each created an electric longboard using a combination of 3D printing techniques.
* The primary goal of the project was to use powder bed fusion (selective laser sintering) and generative design tools available within Fusion 360 to design strong yet lightweight parts for a longboard.
* In addition, we were able to use our professor, Dr. David Florian's large format 3D printer to print a deck for the longboard. More information on the creation of this printer can be found [here](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Projects/LF3DP.html).
* To start with the end in mind, here is the final assembly design of my skateboard in Fusion 360. You are able to toggle the aluminum and polymer truck designs on and off to see the differences within the file:

# Using Generative AI to Design Longboard Trucks
* The first step in our way to making an electric longboard was to use the cutting edge generative design technology available within Fusion 360 to create bespoke aluminum and polymer (Nylon 12) trucks that connect to the baseplate of the longboard.
* The truck is a key component of a longboard, as it distributes the weight and allows for the range of motion that drives and directs the device.

# Aluminum Truck

# Nylon 12 Polymer Truck

* In the designs embedded above, you can most clearly see the difference in material choice within the generative design algorithm. The sheer amount of material generated to account for the forces within my design is significantly higher in the polymer variant than the aluminum.

* But before going any further in the analysis of outcomes, I'd like to further discuss the technologies that we learned about through this process.

# Powder Bed Fusion
* PBF is an additive manufacturing process where a laser or electron beam selectively fuses powdered material to build a component layer by layer.
* This technique is particularly useful for creating complex geometries that are difficult or impossible to manufacture using traditional methods, as its specific advantage is how it allows for unsupported geometries and overhangs, which removes a major set of design constraints.

# Generative Design
* Generative design is an iterative process that harnesses the power of trained machine learning models to generate structures and shapes that meet given load constraints.
* With the user input of these goals and constraints, the software within Fusion 360 can explore many possible configurations to find the most efficient design, often appearing as a more organic, unconventional solution.

# Synergies
* The respective strengths of generative design tools and powder bed fusion allows for almost limitless possibilities in design and creation. In essence, the technology of PBF in allowing for unsupported geometries enables more possibilties and connections to explore. The resulting parts can be both strong and lightweight, if the user inputs of constraints and goals are well bounded and directed.

# Potential in Aerospace & Automotive Industry
* In automotive, and especially aerospace engineering, weight-to-performance ratio is crucial. As such, the synergistic advantages of these two technologies have great potential for solving for the dual optimization of weight and strength.
* Generative design solutions created with powder bed fusion can lead to products that use fewer resources yet outperform heavier, traditionally designed alternatives​​.
* Not only is there great potential for weight reduction, but there is also potential for the use of generative design in terms of modeling aerodynamics and optimizing for that.
* Altogether, by using algorithms with solid data points on constraints and goals, the aerospace and automotive industry can raise their efficiency of design, hopefully reducing fuel/energy consumption and going further and faster.

# Limitations
*  Complex and expensive -
*  The safety procedures around the operation metal powder bed fusion machines must be extremely rigorous and the machines contained, as the fine metal particles are highly dangerous
*  The costs of operating these machines, in both fixed and variable sense is also incredibly high
*  Post-processing of metal parts -
*  Anything created by a metal powder bed fusion 3D printer must undergo significant post-processing steps that further add to the complications and expenses

# Resulting Use-Cases
*  Due to the aforementioned weaknesses of the technology as it stands, metal powder bed fusion is best for two scenarios (1) mold creation and (2) bespoke needs. To explain this further, below are two examples of each.

#  Michelin - Tire Mold
*  In this scenario, Michelin used a metal powder bed fusion machine to create mold for tire geometries that were fine and complex, and could then be used in the creation of innumerable tires going forward.

#  Bugatti - Brake Caliper
* The brake caliper created here with metal powder bed fusion was created specifically for an extremely high performance vehicle, which represents the bespoke usage where there is great potential across automotive and aerospace industries. Whether metal powder bed fusion is used for a plane, a Bugatti, or a F1 racecar, the advantages are most clear at the cutting edge of performance.

# Going Forward
* The unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative design is paving the way for revolutionary changes in aerospace and automotive industries.
* The ability to create optimized, lightweight, and strong components is not only enhancing the performance and efficiency of these sectors but also contributing to more sustainable practices.
* As these technologies continue to evolve, they are likely to unlock even more groundbreaking possibilities, reshaping the way we approach design and manufacturing in these critical industries. But it is important to recognize the limitations of cost and scalability in understanding how the market for powder bed fusion and generative design shift and develop in the years to come.

# Longboard Deck
* After printing our generatively designed longboard trucks in Nylon 12 polymer, the final step was to design and print large-format longboard decks.
* As mentioned above, we were able to print these using [Dr. Florian's custom 3D printer](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Projects/LF3)
* The design I created for a longboard deck is embedded below for perusal, it was created with standard geometries and optimized for deflection.

# Longboard Deck

* Our given design constraint in the assignment was to limit the maximum deflection to 12mm, which can be calculated through the use of Fusion 360's Simulation tool. A force around 700N simulates the weight of a person standing on the deck, assuming ABS for the sake of Fusion.
  
# Deflection Simulation (700N)

# Iteration
* My final deflection number sat at a maximum of ~10.5mm, with a board thickness of 19.5mm.
* The original design I created was at a thickness of 17mm, but I had to make a slight adjustment to meet the design constraint.
* Fortunately, the use of a simulation tool within Fusion 360 prevented the need to conduct multiple prints to guess and check, which would have had significant material costs even with plastic due to the large format nature of this design.
  
# Deck Design
* The design of my longboard design was relatively straightforward, with the objectives to (1) meet deflection standard, (2) strike a balance between strength and flexibility, and (3) fit within standard longboard sizes.
* To start with the simplest criteria, I selected a wheelbase of 27" which is within the standard range of 25" to 35" for longboards. My hope here was to minimize the weight of the board, knowing the thickness of plastic required to limit deflection sufficiently. I also was hoping to experiment with a smaller longboard just for mobility, though knowing it will risk stability.
* The second criteria, strength and flexibility, I sought to achieve by simple geometric (largely circular) cutouts of the standard board base. I wanted the board to be perforated, with small enough holes to maintain strength but still save on material use, weight, and range of flexibility.
* The third major criteria was the aforementioned deflection simulation, which is important as it prevents the rider's weight from deforming the board to the extent of contact between the ground and undercarriage which would likely result in an accident and severe damage.
* The only other major design component to mention is the cutout on either end of the wheelbase, which is a given space for a plate that will attach the baseplate to the longboard. If we instead attempted to attach the baseplate to the 3D printed board, there would occur shearing between the layer lines and the fastener with continued use.
