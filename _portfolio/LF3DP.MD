# Features

* **Syringe pumps are specialized pumps that are commonly used in laboratories and medical facilities to administer fluids such as medications and nutrients.
* **Capable of delivering a wide range of flow rates, with several advantages over other types of pumps, such as highly accurate/predictable results, the ability to pump high viscosity fluids, and the capability for non-pulsatile flow.
